# MassMine_YT_GUI_Design
MassMine is a free social media and web scraping tool designed for researchers by researchers. It is currently available as a command-line tool (It can be downloaded from www.massmine.org) to scrape tweets from Twitter. It is currently in its second round of funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The MassMine team is working on expanding the tool to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make it more accessible to researchers who cannot/do not want to use the command-line interface (CLI).  Since Twitter is the only platform currently available, the MassMine team is working on expanding the tool to include more platforms such as YouTube, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Reddit, etc.<br>

My specific role involved expanding the MassMine GUI prototype to include the YouTube platform as a data source and to test the usability of the proposed YouTube-based pages. I worked under the guidance of Dr. Claire Lauer, User Experience course professor and MassMine Co-Principal Investigator.
